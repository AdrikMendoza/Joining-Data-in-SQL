# Joining Data in SQL
The aim of this repository is to document the skills I've learned to master inner and outer joins, as well as self joins, semi joins, anti joins and cross joinsâ€”fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. 
Learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples.
